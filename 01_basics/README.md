# Variables, Types, and Logical Operations

We will begin by learning how to store information in containers known as
variables then we will discuss the different types of data that may be held in
variables. We will build upon our knowledge by reviewing how to manipulate and
display the variables we are working with.

Next, we will learn how to properly format our code and add logic to our code. We
will examine syntax indentation. Then review compound logical expressions.
Next, we will use if-statements, elif-statements, and else-statements to
branch our code and produce variable output depending on the input.

Finally, we will learn about loops. The first loop we will learn about is the
while-loops and how we can use them to execute code multiple times.
Additionally, we will learn how to use the Read–evaluate–print loop structure to
create basic user interfaces. The last loop will discuss are for-loops, we
will talk about how we can use them to execute code multiple times.
Additionally, we learn about various flow control operators and how to
effectively loop through each
character of a string.
